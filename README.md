# The Flying Teacup Project

* WIP!
* Using three.js to build an interactive 3D web environment, and incorporating meshes built in Blender.
* You can play with it <a href='https://allbecauseyoutoldmeso.github.io/flying_teacup'>here</a>.
* Scroll to zoom in and out, click and drag to spin the teacup around, or use the arrow keys to pan across the screen.
